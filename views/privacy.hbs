						  <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS OFFERED OR PROVIDED ON ANY OF THE WEB SITES REFERRED TO IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY.<br>
						    <br>
						    PLEASE NOTE: THIS PRIVACY POLICY MAY CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME AND CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE UPON POSTING. PLEASE CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY FOR UPDATES AS IT IS YOUR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE AWARE OF CHANGES. WE DO NOT PROVIDE NOTICES OF CHANGES IN ANY MANNER OTHER THAN BY POSTING THE CHANGES AT THIS WEB SITE. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>This Privacy Policy describes the information collection, use, and dissemination practices of this Web site, and applies to our collection, use, storage and disclosure of information by us on our (a) Web sites, including all our divisions, subsidiaries and related companies and (b) on various third party Web sites. We are not responsible for the information collection or privacy practices of third party Web sites or applications. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Information We Collect</strong><br>
						    We recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect on our Web sites to provide you with a superior shopping experience and to communicate with you about our products, services, and promotions. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Your Account</strong><br>
						    When you place an order, we will ask you to set up "your account," which includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, as well as certain other information when you order. Using your account information, we will send you communications that we believe are relevant to you, including newsletters and e-mails. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Information Automatically Collected</strong><br>
						    We automatically receive and collect certain types of information whenever you visit our Web site. For example, like many Web sites, we use "cookies" and Web beacons (described below) and obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our Web sites. This information includes the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, your browser software and operating system, your web server, the date and time you access our site, session information (such as download errors and page response times), information about your viewing, search and purchase history and information about the referring URL and the URL clickstream to, through, and from our Web sites. We use this information to monitor the usage and performance of our Web site, to enhance our customers' search and shopping experiences and to determine aggregate information about our user base and usage patterns. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Information From Third Parties</strong><br>
						    If we receive updated account information from third parties, we may revise your account for you so that we can efficiently process your orders, deliver your products or otherwise communicate with you. For example, we may receive customer information from our shippers or from third parties with which we operate co-branded businesses. In addition, we may acquire customer names, e-mail addresses and mailing addresses for select mailings from third parties. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Other Information You Provide</strong><br>
						    We collect additional information that you choose to give us. For example, you provide information to us when you complete surveys or contest entry forms, add items to "Your Wish List," sign up for special discounts or coupons, communicate with us by e-mail, phone or otherwise, provide product reviews, or provide alternative delivery addresses. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Sharing Your Information with Third Parties</strong><br>
						    We protect all of your information against unauthorized access or release. We share your personal and shipping information with third parties as follows: <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>* Brand Manufacturers - We may develop programs with some of our brand manufacturers through which you may be offered special discounts or coupons on products in exchange for providing your e-mail address or completing a survey about the manufacturer's products. When you are offered such discounts or coupons in exchange for providing information (for example, giving your e-mail address or completing a survey), you will be notified that if you choose to participate, your name, e-mail address and responses will be shared with the brand manufacturer. No other information will be shared. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>* Agents - We may enter into agreements with other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include sending promotional e-mails on our behalf to such companies' customers; serving advertisements on our behalf, analyzing data; providing marketing assistance; processing credit card or debit card payments; and fulfilling and delivering orders. These companies and individuals have access only to information necessary to perform their functions. They are not allowed to use the information for any other purpose and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of the information. We may share non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>* Business Transfers - We may buy or sell stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information is usually treated as one of the transferred business assets. Should we sell all or substantially all of our assets, customer information will be one of the transferred business assets. In that event, we will post a notification on this page or send you an e-mail so that you are always aware of how your information is being used. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>* Compliance with Law; Protection of Rights, Property or Safety - We will disclose account and other personal information when we believe that disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or other policies or user agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of our business, our customers, or others. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p>* As You Direct - If you direct, we will release customer information to your authorized representative(s) or such other person as you may direct. From time to time, we may partner with certain companies who, in conjunction with their membership programs or rewards programs, require that we disclose purchasing information about their members who visit our Web site (for example, to earn points for purchases made on our site through links from the partner site). We will disclose only the information required to make these programs work for you and support your membership in them. In addition, we disclose this information to such companies only if you have consented first, including consent implied by your agreement to the membership or participation rules. If you do not want us to disclose that information to the strategic partner, then you must contact the partner directly. <br>
						    Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>No Collection of Information from Children</strong><br>
						    Our Web site is not intended for users under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect or retain information in connection with the web siteSite from children under the age of 18. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
						    When you place an order online with us, your personal information and credit card or debit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. We use SSL technology to prevent your information from being stolen or intercepted during any transfer to us. Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a restricted-access database that is away from our Web site database so it is not connected to the Internet, to keep it safe from hackers. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br>
						    To personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience, we use a feature on your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to retrieve certain information previously provided by you to us, so that you do not need to re-enter this information every time you shop at the site. Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular web site or advertisement). Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can be accessed only when you enter your name and password. If you choose to configure your browser to remove or reject our cookies, you will not be able to make purchases from our Web stores or take advantage of many of our features. You may read more about cookies at http://cookiecentral.com. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong><br>
						    From time to time we contract with third party companies to help us better provide relevant products, services and information to you and to help us effectively measure advertising effectiveness. Some of these companies use cookies and/or Web beacons (also known as action tags or single pixel gifs). A Web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a Web page and sends a signal when a user has visited that page. A Web beacon does not contain any personal information. No information that is personally identifiable to you is transmitted to the third party using the Web beacon. The third party is required to protect the privacy of the information it receives using Web beacons or cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for any purpose beyond what is necessary to assist us. In addition, we may use web beacons in connection with the e-mails we send to our customers, to determine whether and when the images in our e-mail were rendered (which allows us to determine whether the e-mail was opened). This information may then be aggregated and used to assess the effectiveness of our e-mail communications. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Unsolicited E-mail (SPAM)</strong><br>
						    Your privacy is very important to us. You should be aware, however, that unscrupulous marketers can sometimes "harvest" your e-mail address directly from your computer or another person's address book or even obtain your e-mail address through programs that automatically search web pages and e-mail traffic for e-mail addresses. Please note that all e-mail that originates from us will either display the customer service phone number, logo (HTML e-mails only). In addition, our e-mails will contain our corporate address. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Linked Web Sites</strong><br>
						    Our Web sites may contain links to and from other sites operated and maintained by separate companies. We have no responsibility for linked Web sites (including the Web sites of participants in our associate program) and provide these links solely for the convenience and information of our visitors. The privacy policies of these sites may differ from our policy, so you should always review the privacy statement of each linked Web site you visit. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>Your Consent</strong><br>
						    By using our Web site (including through our customer service line), you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of information in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. As stated above, we reserve the right to modify or amend this policy at any time. Unless we clearly state otherwise, the changes to our privacy policy will affect only the information we collect after the effective date of the change. <br>
					      </p>
						  <p><strong>UNSUBSCRIBE PROCEDURES.</strong><br>
						    To unsubscribe from a particular list follow the instructions in each promotional e-mail message sent by us. <br>
